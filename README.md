# 🏆 Mini Sumo Ball Game  
A physics-based sumo brawl where the last ball standing wins!  

This Unity project is a fun, dynamic, and progressively challenging mini sumo ball game, where players (or AI-controlled balls) compete to push each other out of an arena. The game revolves around game mechanics, a single power-up, and increasing difficulty, making it a great playground for experimenting with physics-based interactions and engaging gameplay elements.  

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics  
- **Physics-Driven Battles** – The sumo balls are controlled using physics forces, creating organic and unpredictable movements as they collide and fight for dominance.  
- **Knockback System** – Each impact applies force to opponents, making positioning and momentum control crucial for survival.  
- **Arena Boundaries** – Players must strategize to avoid falling off while pushing others to the edge.  

## 🔥 Power-Up  
- **Knockback Amplifier** – Boosts the force applied when colliding with opponents, leading to stronger hits.  

## 📈 Increasing Difficulty & Progression  
- **Adaptive AI** – Enemy balls become more aggressive and skilled over time.  
- **Dynamic Arena Hazards** – As the game progresses, obstacles such as shrinking platforms or moving barriers add extra challenges.  
- **Wave-Based Difficulty Scaling** – The number and strength of enemies increase with each round, ensuring a progressively harder experience.  

## 🛠️ Learning & Development Goals  
This project was built as a game mechanics practice ground, focusing on:  
- ✅ Implementing physics-based movement in Unity.  
- ✅ Experimenting with power-ups for dynamic gameplay.  
- ✅ Creating a progressive difficulty system that keeps players engaged.  
- ✅ Refining collision detection and force application for smooth interactions.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- 🔹 Multiplayer mode for local or online play.  
- 🔹 More diverse arenas with environmental effects.  
- 🔹 Leaderboards and scoring system.
