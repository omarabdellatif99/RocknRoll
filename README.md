# 🏆 Mini Sumo Ball Game  
A physics-based sumo brawl where the last ball standing wins!  

This Unity Project was part of the Unity programmer pathway as I was introduced to new concepts in Game programming by adding new Game mechanics like difficulty increasing and powerups

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics  
- **Physics-Driven Battles** – The sumo balls are controlled using physics forces also the Camera,creating a challenging way of controlling the ball, and unpredictable movements as it collides and fight for dominance.  
- **Knockback System** – Each impact applies force to opponents, making positioning and momentum control crucial for survival.  
- **Arena Boundaries** – Players must strategize to avoid falling off while pushing others to the edge.  

## 🔥 Power-Up  
- **Knockback Amplifier** – Boosts the force applied when colliding with opponents, leading to stronger hits.  
- **Fire balls** – This powerUp mechanic will be added in the future as am working on refining and refactoring several game projects i have been working on .  

## 📈 Increasing Difficulty & Progression  
- **Wave-Based Difficulty Scaling** – The number of enemies increase with each wave, ensuring a progressively harder experience.  

## 🛠️ Learning & Development Goals  
This project was built as a game mechanics practice ground, focusing on:  
- ✅ Implementing physics-based movement in Unity.  
- ✅ Experimenting with power-ups for dynamic gameplay.  
- ✅ Creating a progressive difficulty system that keeps players engaged.  
- ✅ Refining collision detection and force application for smooth interactions.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- 🔹 Multiplayer mode for local or online play.  
- 🔹 More diverse arenas with environmental effects.  
- 🔹 More powerups and Enemy types.
